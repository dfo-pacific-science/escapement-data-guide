# Preface {-}

This guidebook aligns DFO Pacific Region Areas on processing escapement inputs
(weirs, sonar, aerial/foot counts, genetic assignments, environmental
covariates) into Conservation Unit (CU)-based, regionally interoperable time
series that satisfy Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) and Fisheries Act reporting.
Chapters map the pipeline: intake and standards, processing and QC, estimation
and outputs, governance and compliance, and supporting assets.
